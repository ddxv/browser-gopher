## Importing from [BrowserParrot][]

Import URLs from BrowserParrot:

```sh
browser-gopher browserparrot
```

Same as above, but with a custom DB path:

```sh
browser-gopher browserparrot --db-path ~/.config/uncloud/persistory.db
```

(This may be useful if you tried out [Uncloud](https://www.uncloud.gg/) and have a browserparrot-like database somewhere else on your system)
